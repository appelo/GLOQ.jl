The concept $\pi$-pulse and $\frac{\pi}{2}$-pulse will be used throuhgt this page.
1. Pi-pulse: $\pi_{k,k+1}$ is a control pulse that excites the control system from state $k$ to state $k+1$.
1. Half-pi-pulse: $\frac{\pi_{k,k+1}}{2}$ make the system transit halfway from $k$ to $k+1$.

# 1. Ramsey $k$-$k+1$ Experiment
The Ramsey $k$-$k+1$ experiment is desinged to measure the dephasing time $T_2$ and the detuning frequency from state $k$ to $k+1$. 
Its workflow is summarized below.
1. Prepare the system to be in excited state $k$.
1. Apply the $\pi_{k,k+1}/2$-pulse  but with a detuned frequency.
1. Let the system propagate freely for some dark time $t_{\textrm{dark}}$.
1. Apply the $\pi_{k,k+1}/2$-pulse again.
1. Measure the population.

# 2. $T_2$-echo Experiment
"The Echo experiment is a modified version of the Ramsey experiment where a $\pi$ pulse is inserted in the middle of the process to enable refocusing and compensate for different spins. This allows the experiment to gather information about the decoherence that is not refocused by the $\pi$ pulse."[^fn1]
The workflow of the Echo $k$-$k+1$ experiment is as follows.
1. Prepare the system to be in excited state $k$.
1. Apply the $\pi_{k,k+1}/2$-pulse.
1. Let the system propagate freely for some dark time $t_{\textrm{dark}}$.
1. Apply the $\pi_{k,k+1}$-pule to start the refocusing.
1. Let the system propagate freely for some dark time $t_{\textrm{dark}}$.
1. Apply the $\pi_{k,k+1}/2$-pulse again.
1. Measure the population.

# 3. $T_1$-decay Experiment
The $T_1$-decay experiment (also called $T_1$-relaxation experiment) is an experiment designed to measure the $T_1$ relaxation time.
1. Prepare the system to be in excited state $k$.
1. Let the system evolve freely and relax back to the ground state. Measure populations at different times.
